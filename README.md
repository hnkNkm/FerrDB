# FerrDB

We welcome any contributions, bug reports, or feature requests!  
Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/yourname/ferrdb).  
If you have suggestions or questions, please share themâ€”your feedback helps us improve FerrDB.

A minimal file-based CLI database written in Rust.  
Stores data in `b.json` for persistence across sessions.

## Overview

- **File-based**: Data is serialized to `db.json` using `serde_json`.
- **CLI-based**: Operate with simple SQL-like commands (`CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`, etc.).
- **Persistent**: Inserted data is saved to disk and reloaded on next startup.



## Requirements


- **Rust** (Edition 2021 or later)
- **Cargo** for building
- `serde` + `serde_json` (already declared in `Cargo.toml`)


## Build & Run

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourname/ferrdb.git
cd ferrdb

# 2. Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# 3. Run the compiled binary
./target/release/ferrdb
```

> For development, you can also use `cargo run`.

## Quick Start

Once you run the binary (or `cargo run`), you can interact with FerrDB via a simple command-line interface:

1. create a table

```
CREATE TABLE users (id, name, age);
```

2. insert data

```
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, "John", 30);
```

3. view data

```praintf
SELECT * FROM users;
```

4. exit

```praintf
exit
```


## Example Session


```
Welcome to SimpleRDB CLI. Type 'exit' to quit.
> CREATE TABLE users (id, name, age);
Table `users` created.
> INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, "John", 30);
Data inserted into 'users'.
> SELECT * FROM users;
Table 'users':
[["id", "name", "age"]
["1", "John", "30"]]
> exit
Goodby!
```

When you restart the application, `db.json` will be loaded, and any previously inserted rows are available.

## Docker (Optional)

If you wish to run FerrDB within a Docker environment:

1. Create a `Dockerfile` that installs Rust and copies this repository.
2. (Optionally) use Docker Compose to mount your working directory for an interactive dev environment.
3. Build and run the container, then manually execute:
```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/ferrdb
```
